* Seperate {in/out}bound filtering dialogues
* Add FTP Pasv/PORT selection option to druid (being worked on ATM - PD)
* Transparent Proxy support
* Better IPSec support
* Better Masquerading IPSec support
* Fix Outbound filtering so it breaks rules down into the first connection
being a NEW packet, and all future packets relating to that connection
become ESTABLISHED.

* IPFilter support (as well as support for Solaris, and other known-to-work
GNOME platforms)
