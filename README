Firestarter
===========
  The latest version of Firestarter can always be found at
            <http://www.fs-security.com>

Firestarter is a complete firewalling tool for Linux. Use the firewall
creation wizard to create a basic firewall, then streamline it further
using the powerful dynamic rules modifiers. Open and close ports with
a few clicks, or stealth your services giving access only to a select 
few. Watch the real-time hit monitor as attackers probe your machine
for open ports, in vain. Firestarter takes full advantage of GNOME but
will work in most environments.

See the "INSTALL" file for installation instructions.
